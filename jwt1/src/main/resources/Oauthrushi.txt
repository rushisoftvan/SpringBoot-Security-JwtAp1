                   Talk about access token

   info : we  can increase the validity of the access token for that you have to use in client
           accessTokenbvalidateSecodmethod

   info :  we can put Authorization server and Resource server in one application but it is not put in real word
          application we can put both in example or poc application. In real word application both are separate

  info : there are two approach token introspection where the resource server call end point on the authorization
          server to find out the details about the token including token is valid token or not
        and Other approach that will black boarding approach but it is not use in real word where we use the share database

  info : usually userDetails service bean is available in context security will get the object from the context
        but this thing is not happen with refresh token grant_type so we have to use explicit
        add in  endpoint method  endpoint.userDetailsService(userDetailService)

info about token introspection first we will use
